Hello my name is Jackie and I am a software engineer.
On my free time I like to read manga and dystopian fantasy novels. 
I like to explore new places and sketch when I get a burst of creativity. 
I'm excited to explore new pathways in the Marcy Lab school especially creativity in the front end pathway.
